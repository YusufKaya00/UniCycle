Below are the updated PlantUML codes in English, designed to look exactly like the diagrams found in your Requirement Specification PDF. You can continuously copy and paste them into https://plantuml.com/plantuml/ to generate the images.

### Figure 1. Simplified system model diagram

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam ClassBackgroundColor white
skinparam ClassBorderColor black
skinparam shadowing false
skinparam RoundCorner 0
hide empty members

class User 

class "1." as step1
class "2." as step2
class "3." as step3
class "4." as step4

User -right-> step1 
step1 -right-> step2
step2 -right-> step3
step3 -right-> step4

note left of User
User
end note
@enduml
```
*(Note: Figure 1 in the PDF is just circles/boxes numbered 1 to 4 connected in a loop with a "User" box on the side. The PDF actually depicts arrows looping from User -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1. Here is a closer match to that visual looping structure:)*

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false

node "User" as user
circle "1." as n1
circle "2." as n2
circle "3." as n3
circle "4." as n4

user -right-> n1
n1 -right-> n2
n2 -right-> n3
n3 -right-> n4
n4 -up-> user : 5.
@enduml
```

### Figure 2. System environment diagram

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false
left to right direction

rectangle "User" as User
rectangle "Interface" as Interface
rectangle "System\nFunctions" as System
rectangle "Database" as Database

User <--> Interface
Interface <--> System
System <--> Database
@enduml
```

### Figure 3. Hierarchical view diagram

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false

rectangle "Information Spaces" as Info

rectangle "Opinions about users and\n their classes" as Users
rectangle "Opinions about non-functional\n requirements" as NonFunctional
rectangle "Opinions about functional\n requirements: system functions\n and functions available to users" as Functional
rectangle "Opinions about the\n database and its objects" as Database

rectangle "Buyer" as Buyer
rectangle "Seller" as Seller

Info -down-> Users
Info -down-> NonFunctional
Info -down-> Functional
Info -down-> Database

Users -down-> Buyer
Users -down-> Seller
@enduml
```

### Figure 4. User registration/authorization activity diagram

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false

title User registration/authorization activity diagram

start
:Enter system;
:Provide Authorization details
(Google Login);
if (Domain is @edu.rtu.lv?) then (yes)
  :Validate user details;
  if (Valid account?) then (yes)
    :Authorize User;
    :Access System Functions;
  else (no)
    :Register User in Database;
    :Authorize User;
    :Access System Functions;
  endif
else (no)
  :Display Error Message;
  :Deny Access;
endif
stop
@enduml
```

### Figure 5. Function activity diagram (e.g., Adding a Listing)

```plantuml
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false

title Function activity diagram

start
:Seller enters listing info;
:Input data:
- Title, Category, Price
- Images
- Location (Map);
if (Is data valid?) then (yes)
  :Save data to database;
  :Display success message;
  :Show updated listings;
else (no)
  :Display error message;
endif
stop
@enduml
```
